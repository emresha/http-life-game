# A simple http-server of life game (made with Ya.Lyceum)

This program is a game of life, but a server version.

When you type `go run cmd/life/main.go` it runs a server on `localhost:8081`.

After that you need to visit `localhost:8081`, where you will see the magic happen:)

this is just practice in go
